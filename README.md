## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run AlgoTrader locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   npm or Yarn
*   Docker (for the monitoring stack)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DEEPML1818/AlgoTrader.git
    cd AlgoTrader
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Database Setup:**
    AlgoTrader uses PostgreSQL. You can set up a local PostgreSQL instance or use a cloud provider like Neon or Supabase.
    *   Refer to `setup-database.md` in the project root for detailed instructions on connecting your database.
    *   Once your `DATABASE_URL` is configured in your `.env` file, run migrations:
        ```bash
        npm run db:push
        ```
        This will create all necessary tables.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server (Frontend & Backend API):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the React frontend and the Node.js Express backend API. The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar port if configured by Vite).

2.  **Start the Metrics Server (Optional, for Prometheus integration):**
    ```bash
    npm run metrics
    ```
    This server exposes trading system metrics to Prometheus.

3.  **Start the Monitoring Stack (Optional, requires Docker):**
    Navigate to the `client/src/monitoring` directory and start the Docker Compose services:
    ```bash
    cd client/src/monitoring
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This will launch Prometheus, Grafana, and Node Exporter.
    *   Grafana: `http://localhost:3000` (default admin/admin)
    *   Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090`
